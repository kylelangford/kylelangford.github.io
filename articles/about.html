              My name is Kyle Langford. As an Interactive Designer I am an essential
              part of any project or product team. I combine a strong front end
              development skillset with a talent for crafting great UI designs. I
              have an aspiring interest in understanding more about the User
              Experiences. I am involved in the strategic / research aspects of
              projects and provide quick prototyping and wireframing capabilities.
              This helps teams move from sketches direct to code – good code –
              efficiently.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              I work well sketching with team members and building prototypes and
              proofs of concepts. I like to focus on whether the interactions,
              process, flow, and the overall experience of the product working well
              for the end user.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <strong>As a leader and mentor</strong> I have experience managing
              expectations, communicating ideas and developing team strategies. I
              make sure to ask the right questions: is the product intuitive, easy
              to use and, ultimately, does it meet the user’s goals and
              expectations?
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <strong>As a designer</strong> I want to share ownership of the UX, I
              enjoy working on defining the product, the audience, and conducting
              research. Being involved early allows me to understand the rationale
              behind the product and design approach and helps me to make good,
              consistent, UX decisions without needing every piece of UI defined.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <strong>As a developer</strong> I produce standards driven, production
              quality code. I have experience on building content heavy websites and
              theming Drupal and Shopify themes.
